Question 8, Conv2D also learns how to best combine all input channels, so it is actually a 3D convolution



Question 17, 128 channels (= number of filters)



This



val_generator = datagen.flow(Xval, Yval, batch_size=100,subset='validation')



should be



val_generator = datagen.flow(Xtrain, Ytrain, batch_size=100,subset='validation')



as the generator keeps track of its own validation data



Question 24, yes flow_from_directory



Question 28, yes as in fully convolutional CNNs
